# WEB102 Prework - Yele

Submitted by: Kareem Diabate

Yele is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [ ] I added the pledged and goal numbers under the games description to be able to check if my filtering function worked

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was bit hard for me to complete challenge three because it has been while I coded, I forgot some of the syntaxes but Google was my friend lol.
